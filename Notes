The code is split into the following pieces:
(a) min-hash generation
(b) createSparseGraph(), which includes the following steps: 
    for each threshold of similarity,
      for each document (or node), 
         createSuperHash() // according to the threshold
      sortSuperHashes() 
      addEdgesToSparseGraph()
  FilterCandidates()
(c) TSP()

1. Very short documents are treated automatically.
2. for each term in each document, we apply the k-th minwise hash function and keep the min value
3. similarity measure: intersection or jaccard (# same minhashes / # minhashes)
